    - **Encapsulation:** Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
    - **Inheritance:** Creating a new class from an existing class.
    - **Polymorphism:** The ability to call the same method on different objects and have them respond in their own way.
    - **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features of the object.
2. **Class and Object:**
    
    - Difference between a class and an object.
    - How to create and use classes and objects in your preferred language.
3. **Constructor and Destructor:**

    - Usage and rules for constructors and destructors.
    - Constructor overloading.
5. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes:**
    
    - Differences and when to use each.
    - How to implement multiple inheritance using interfaces.
5. **Access Modifiers:**
    
    - `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default/package-private.

#### **Common Interview Questions:**

1. Explain the difference between abstract classes and interfaces.
2. What is polymorphism? Can you give an example?
3. How does inheritance work? What are some of its drawbacks?

    - Basic operations, searching, sorting, and manipulating.
2. **Linked Lists:**
    
    - Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
    - Common operations: insertion, deletion, reversal, finding the middle element.
3. **Stacks and Queues:**
    
    - Implementations using arrays and linked lists.
    - Common operations: push, pop, peek, enqueue, dequeue.
4. **Trees:**
    
    - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees.
    - Tree traversals: In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order.
    - Common operations: insertion, deletion, searching.
5. **Graphs:**

2. Detect and remove a cycle in a linked list.
3. Implement a stack using two queues.
4. Find the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree.
5. Implement BFS and DFS for a graph.

#### **Practice:**

- **Cracking the Coding Interview:** Good resource for common data structure problems.
- **Mock Interviews:** Try coding interviews to practice data structure problems under time constraints.

### **Interview Preparation Strategy:**

1. **Allocate Time Efficiently:**
    
    - SQL: 4-6 hours for practicing queries and understanding concepts.
    - OOP: 3-4 hours to review concepts and implement simple designs.
    - Data Structures: 6-8 hours on problem-solving in common data structures.
2. **Mock Interviews and Practice:**
    
    - Spend some time on mock interviews to get used to thinking and explaining your thought process under pressure.
3. **Build Confidence:**
    
    - Revise key concepts and practice explaining them clearly and concisely.
